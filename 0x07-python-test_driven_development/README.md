Higher-level programming - Python
This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming track at ALX Africa. In these projects, which began occurring in month four of the year one curriculum, I am currently learning Python. Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

0x00. Python - Hello, World
0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
0x02. Python - import & modules
0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
0x05. Python - Exceptions
